# BCounter - The Budget Counter App

BCounter is an application created to help manage where the money in your pocket is going: 

## How it works
 1. Login to the site. If you don't have an account, you can always register on our site. 
 2. After logging in to the site, you can look at your current expenditure for the day, week, or month. 
 3. Navigate to the bottom of the pie chart to add an entry. 
 4. Enter the amount, select a category, write a note, and hit 'submit' to log the entry and route back to the pie chart. 
 5. If you need to edit an entry, you can hit 'edit' next to that entry to do so. 
 6. If you need to delete an entry, hitting the 'delete' button will help you out with that. 
 7. Be smart with your money by using this app!

ERD:

## Approach taken:
We came together as a group to create an application that would help us solidify our skills in this stack as well as be used by people. 

## Technologies used:	
	 - SQLite3
	 - Express
	 - React.js
	 - Node
	 - Moment.js
	 - Chart.js
	 - FontAwesome

## MVP Functionality
When we created our MVP, we had an idea of what the MVP functionality would be:

 - Have a login/registration page
 - Make sure JSON-Web-Token Authentication works
 - Being able to create, read, update, and delete all entries
 - Make sure pie chart displays all categories
 - Make sure we displayed the total amount spent and the amount in each category that was spent
 - Be able to view/edit/delete your profile information
 - Have a working hamburger menu
 - Have decent styling

 

## Goals for improvement
We'd like to get feedback from users to see what we can improve upon. (insert more)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
